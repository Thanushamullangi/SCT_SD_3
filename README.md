Sudoku Solver (Python)
Project Description:

This project is a Python-based Sudoku Solver that uses the Backtracking Algorithm to solve a 9×9 Sudoku puzzle.

The user enters the Sudoku grid row by row, using 0 for empty cells, and the program automatically finds and displays the correct solution.

 Features:

Solves any valid 9×9 Sudoku puzzle

Uses backtracking for accurate results

Accepts user input

Displays solved board neatly

Detects if no solution exists

Beginner-friendly logic

How It Works:

Finds an empty cell (value 0)

Tries numbers from 1 to 9

Checks if the number is valid

Places the number temporarily

Uses recursion to continue solving

Backtracks if a wrong choice is made

This process continues until the puzzle is solved.
